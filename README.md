# ConsoleFlags
ConsoleFlags is a .NET Core library that I created for my own convenience. It's desgined to make any .NET console application look more vivid and easier to read.
It has a few premade flags such as `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`, as well as the ability to make your own flags that fit your own needs.
